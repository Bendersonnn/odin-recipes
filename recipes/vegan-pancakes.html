        <h4>Make this great base for vegan pancakes: use your favourite plant-based milk, and add vegan choc chips, blueberries, or anything else you fancy</h4>

        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

        <ul>
            <li>300g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp sugar (any kind) </li>
            <li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>400ml plant-based milk (such as oat, almond or soya) </li>
            <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil for cooking</li>
         </ul>
            
         <p><h3>To serve (optional)</h3></p>

         <ul>
             <li>banana slices, blueberries, maple syrup, vegan chocolate chips, plant-based yogurt </li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Method</h2>
         <ol>
             <li>Whisk the flour, baking powder, sugar, vanilla extract and a pinch of salt in a bowl using a balloon whisk until mixed. Slowly pour in the milk until you get a smooth, thick batter.</li>
             <li>Heat a little of the oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat, and add 2 tbsp batter into the pan at a time to make small, round pancakes. You will need to do this in batches of two-three at a time. 
                 Cook for 3-4 mins until the edges are set, and bubbles are appearing on the surface. Flip the pancakes over and cook for another 2-3 mins until golden on both sides and cooked through. 
                 Keep warm in a low oven while you cook the remaining pancakes. </li>
            <li>Serve stacked with lots of toppings of your choice, or serve with bowls of toppings for everyone to help themselves.</li>
